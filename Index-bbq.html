            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Take out ham and place in a baking dish. I use foil ones. And cover with both AP and Bbq seasoning. Let sit.</li>
                <li>Prepare smoker to 250<sup>o</sup>f and 275<sup>o</sup></sup>f</li>
                <li>Add favorite wood, chips, or pellets. I use a blend of maple and cherry woods.</li>
                <li>Place ham in smoker and allow it to heat through. Usually around 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Around the 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> hour mark, prepare glaze.</li>
                <li>Once ham is warm all the way through, add glaze and resume smoking for 30 to 45 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove ham. Let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve</li>
            </ol>
